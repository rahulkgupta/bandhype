# Description
This project was done as part of my Big Data class. It depicts the popularity of bands across time and location use tweets that include a band name and a geotag.
There are various insights gained from combining time, location, and bands.
- You can see a band go on tour, as certain locations tweet a band's name far more than other locations.
- You can see which bands are the most popular within a specific location and see how that changes over time, as new songs come out and bands come to perform.
- You can see which locations a band is more popular in, thereby predicting the best locations for performances.
